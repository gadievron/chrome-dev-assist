**Production Status:** ‚úÖ READY
- Console capture working (validated via extension logs)
- Auth token flow working
- Tab operations with timeout protection

- Page-ready signal reducing test time (10s ‚Üí 3s typical)

**Extension Validation (from console logs):**
```
‚úÖ 6/6 console messages captured
‚úÖ Page-ready signal working (3s completion)
‚úÖ Auth token added to URLs
‚úÖ No crashes during capture
‚úÖ Clean shutdown detection active
```

## üîÑ Next Session Tasks

**PRIORITY: Expert Review & HTML Tests**

**Task 1: Multi-Persona Test Review**
1. **Tester Persona** - Review test coverage, edge cases, boundary conditions
2. **QA Persona** - Integration scenarios, user workflows, quality gates
3. **Security Researcher Persona** - Attack vectors, injection risks, auth bypass

**Task 2: Test Gap Analysis**
- Identify missing test scenarios
- Suggest additional unit tests
- Suggest integration tests
- Suggest security tests

**Task 3: HTML Test Suite**
- Create browser-based test fixtures
- Test console capture with real DOM operations
- Test timeout scenarios in real browser
- Test page-ready signal with various page types
- Test auth token flow end-to-end

**Task 4: Execute and Validate**
- Run HTML tests in Chrome
- Verify all scenarios pass
- Document results
- Update TO-FIX.md if issues found

---

## üìÅ Current File State

**Extension Code (Production Ready):**
- extension/background.js (2385 lines) - All features implemented
- extension/inject-console-capture.js (96 lines) - Page-ready signal active
- extension/content-script.js (47 lines) - Forwarding working
- extension/modules/ConsoleCapture.js (unused - for future refactoring)

**Test Files (53 tests, all passing):**
- tests/unit/tab-operations-timeout.test.js (15 tests)
- tests/unit/clean-shutdown-detection.test.js (14 tests)
- tests/unit/smarter-completion-detection.test.js (16 tests)
- tests/unit/auth-token-fixture-access.test.js (8 tests)

**Documentation (Complete):**
- SESSION-SUMMARY-COMPLETE-2025-10-26.md (comprehensive session summary)
- ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS-2025-10-26.md (architecture review)
- DEAD-CODE-AUDIT-2025-10-26.md (audit results)
- TO-FIX.md (ISSUE-015, 016, 017 documented and resolved)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

**ISSUE-014: Prototype Server Confusion** (CRITICAL - development productivity)
- Status: Identified, not blocking
- Impact: Can waste hours if wrong server started
- Multiple prototype server processes still running (see background bash shells)
- Recommendation: Kill all prototype servers, document/remove in next session

**Background Processes (Need Cleanup):**
- Multiple node servers running on port 9876
- Multiple prototype/server.js instances
- Recommendation: Kill all and start clean in next session

---

## üîß Deferred Work

**From Previous Session:**
1. Background.js refactoring (~8 hours)
   - Split 2385-line file into 6 modules
   - Use existing modules/ directory
   - Create StateManager, TabManager, CommandHandlers

2. Prototype server resolution (ISSUE-014)
   - Kill running instances
   - Remove or document clearly
   - Update documentation

3. Wrap remaining tab operations
   - chrome.tabs.reload() with timeout
   - chrome.tabs.get() in metadata extraction

---

## üíæ How to Resume

**Load This Checkpoint:**
1. Read this file (.checkpoint-2025-10-26-expert-review-planned.md)
2. Read previous checkpoint (.checkpoint-2025-10-26-dead-code-complete.md)
3. Run tests to verify state: `npm test`
4. Review TO-FIX.md for current issues

**Continue With Expert Review:**
1. Use Tester persona to review 53 tests for coverage gaps
2. Use QA persona to identify integration test needs
3. Use Security Researcher persona to identify security test gaps
4. Create comprehensive HTML test suite
5. Execute HTML tests in real browser
6. Document findings and create additional tests as needed

**Before Starting:**
- Kill all background server processes
- Start clean server: `node server/websocket-server.js`
- Verify extension loaded and connected
- Run existing tests to confirm baseline: `npm test`

- [x] All tests passing (53/53, 100%)
- [x] Surgical changes only (~150 lines)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [x] Architecture issues identified
- [x] No regressions

**Current Session:**

## üéì Notes for Next Session

**User Request:**
> "use tester and qa and security personas to look at tests completeness and suggest more tests, and html tests. launch html tests"

**Approach:**
1. Follow test-first discipline for HTML tests
2. Use multi-persona review (Tester, QA, Security)
3. Create HTML fixtures in fixtures/ directory
4. Write test runner scripts
5. Execute in real browser
6. Document all findings

**Extension Console Validation:**
The extension is working correctly based on logs:
- 6 console messages captured from test-console-simple.html
- Auth token properly added to URLs
- Page-ready signal triggered early completion (3s instead of 10s)
- No errors during capture
