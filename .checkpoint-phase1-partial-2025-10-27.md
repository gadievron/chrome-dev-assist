# Checkpoint - Phase 1 Partial Progress

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Task:** Project Cleanup & Streamline Plan - Phase 1 (Documentation Analysis)
**Status:** ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (Tasks 1.1 & 1.2 complete)

---

## SESSION CONTEXT

### What We're Doing

Comprehensive 7-phase project cleanup analysis:

- Phase 1: Documentation Analysis (CURRENT)
- Phase 2-7: Code inventory, duplicates, connections, gaps, cleanup, architecture

### Current Phase Progress

**Phase 1: Documentation Analysis** - 2 of 5 subtasks complete

‚úÖ Task 1.1: Extract function references from documentation (DONE)
‚úÖ Task 1.2: Investigate unknown functions (DONE)
‚è≥ Task 1.3: Extract feature claims from COMPLETE-FUNCTIONALITY-MAP
‚è≥ Task 1.4: Cross-reference with phantom APIs list
‚è≥ Task 1.5: Create CLAIMED-FEATURES-INVENTORY.md

---

## KEY FINDINGS SO FAR

### Functions Found in Documentation (23 total)

#### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (8 public APIs):

1. captureLogs
2. closeTab
3. getAllExtensions
4. getExtensionInfo
5. openUrl
6. reload
7. reloadAndCapture
8. reloadTab

#### ‚ùå PHANTOM APIs (11 of 16 found in general docs):

1. abortTest
2. captureScreenshot
3. disableExtension
4. enableExtension
5. endTest
6. getPageMetadata
7. getTestStatus
8. startTest
9. toggleExtension
10. verifyCleanup
11. (5 more phantom APIs exist but only referenced in test files)

#### ‚ùå NEW DISCOVERIES - Documented But Not Implemented (4):

1. **closeChromeInstance** - referenced in docs, doesn't exist in code
2. **forceReload** - referenced in docs, doesn't exist in code
3. **freshStart** - referenced in docs, doesn't exist in code
4. **connect** - docs reference, but only connectToServer() internal function exists

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT INTEGRATED (1):

1. **level4ReloadCDP** - exists in claude-code/level4-reload-cdp.js but not exposed in main API

---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**Total Documented-But-Missing Functions: 20**

- 16 phantom APIs (known, with tests)
- 4 new phantom-like functions (documented but no code, no tests)

This is WORSE than previously documented. Documentation references functions that don't exist anywhere.

---

## FILES CREATED

1. **PHASE1-WORKING-NOTES.md** - Detailed working notes for Phase 1
   - Contains function categorization
   - Investigation results for unknown functions
   - Stop point clearly marked

---

## NEXT STEPS

When resuming:

1. Open PHASE1-WORKING-NOTES.md
2. Read from "üõë STOP POINT" marker
3. Continue with Task 1.3: Extract feature claims from COMPLETE-FUNCTIONALITY-MAP.md
4. Complete Tasks 1.4 and 1.5
5. Create CLAIMED-FEATURES-INVENTORY.md deliverable

## WORKING FILES

**Primary:** PHASE1-WORKING-NOTES.md
**Checkpoint:** .checkpoint-phase1-partial-2025-10-27.md (this file)

**Todo List State:**

```
Phase 1: IN PROGRESS
  ‚úÖ 1.1: Extract function references (23 found)
  ‚úÖ 1.2: Investigate unknowns (5 checked)
  ‚è≥ 1.3: Extract feature claims
  ‚è≥ 1.4: Cross-reference phantoms
  ‚è≥ 1.5: Create inventory document
```

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

**User Guidance Followed:**

- ‚úÖ Be careful, check yourself
- ‚úÖ Don't skip, don't guess
- ‚úÖ One step at a time, be patient
- ‚úÖ Stick with it methodically
- ‚úÖ Break big tasks into smaller chunks
- ‚úÖ Can halt gracefully and resume

**Search Methods Used:**

- grep for function patterns in docs
- grep for implementations in code
- Systematic verification (didn't guess)

## RESUME INSTRUCTIONS

```bash
# 1. Read the working notes
cat PHASE1-WORKING-NOTES.md

# 2. Review findings so far
# - 23 functions documented
# - 8 implemented
# - 11 phantom APIs in docs
# - 4 new phantom-like functions
# - 1 implemented but not integrated

# 3. Continue with Task 1.3
# Read COMPLETE-FUNCTIONALITY-MAP.md
# Extract all feature claims
# Compare with what we found so far

# 4. Then Task 1.4
# Cross-reference 16 phantom APIs list with our findings

# 5. Finally Task 1.5
# Create comprehensive CLAIMED-FEATURES-INVENTORY.md
```
