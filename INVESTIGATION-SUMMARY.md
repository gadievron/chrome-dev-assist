# WebSocket Connection Issue - Investigation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Issue:** Recurring ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

User reported recurring ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors when extension tried to connect to WebSocket server at ws://localhost:9876.

---

## Investigation Process

### 1. Server Status Check

```bash
$ lsof -i :9876 -P -n
```

**Finding:** Server WAS running and extension WAS connected!

- Server (PID 19389): Listening on 127.0.0.1:9876
- Chrome (PID 1543): ESTABLISHED connection from 127.0.0.1:65427

### 2. Connection Test

Created `test-connection-simple.js` to test basic WebSocket connection.

**Result:** ‚úÖ Connection works perfectly!

### 3. Extension Registration Test

Created `test-list-extensions.js` to check if extension was registered.

**Result:** ‚úÖ Extension "Chrome Dev Assist" (gnojocphflllgichkehjhkojkihcihfn) was registered with full capabilities!

### 4. Reload Command Test

Attempted to reload extension to apply ErrorLogger changes.

**Result:** ‚ùå Failed with error: "options is not defined"

**Root Cause:** Bug in `background.js:655`

```javascript
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
if (extension.id === chrome.runtime.id && !options?.allowSelfReload) {

// AFTER (FIXED):
if (extension.id === chrome.runtime.id && !params?.allowSelfReload) {
```

### 5. Bug Fix Applied

- Fixed parameter name: `options` ‚Üí `params`
- Used `forceReload` command to reload extension with fixed code
- Extension successfully reloaded with ErrorLogger

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Primary Issue: Stale Error Messages

The ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors were from **previous failed connection attempts** (before server was started). Once the server was running, the extension automatically reconnected successfully via its exponential backoff reconnection logic.

**Evidence:**

- `lsof` showed ESTABLISHED connection
- `listExtensions` command returned registered extension
- Simple connection test succeeded immediately

### Secondary Issue: Code Bug

Found and fixed bug in reload command handler where `options?.allowSelfReload` should have been `params?.allowSelfReload`.

This bug prevented the extension from reloading itself, which was needed to apply the ErrorLogger changes.

---

## Solutions Applied

### 1. WebSocket Connection

**Solution:** No action needed - connection was already working.

**Recommendation:** Clear extension console after successful reconnection to avoid confusion from old error messages.

### 2. Reload Command Bug

**Solution:** Fixed parameter name in `extension/background.js:655`

**File:** `extension/background.js`
**Line:** 655
**Change:** `options?.allowSelfReload` ‚Üí `params?.allowSelfReload`

### 3. Extension Reload

**Solution:** Used `forceReload` command to reload extension with bug fix.

**Command:** `test-force-reload.js`

## Web Research Findings

### Chrome Extension WebSocket Best Practices

**Service Worker Lifecycle (Chrome 116+):**

- Service workers auto-terminate after 30s of inactivity
- WebSocket connections can keep service worker alive
- **Recommendation:** Send keepalive messages every 20s

**Common ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED Causes:**

1. ~~Server not running~~ ‚úÖ Server was running
2. ~~Port binding issues~~ ‚úÖ Correctly bound to 127.0.0.1
3. ~~localhost resolution~~ ‚úÖ Resolved correctly
4. **Old error messages** ‚úÖ This was the actual issue
5. Service worker lifecycle - May benefit from keepalive messages

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

1. Server confirmed running and accepting connections
2. Extension confirmed connected and registered
3. Bug in reload command identified and fixed
4. Extension reloaded with ErrorLogger implementation
5. Verification instructions provided to user

### ‚è≥ Pending User Action

**Manual Verification Required:**

User needs to verify ErrorLogger in Chrome:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Chrome Dev Assist"
3. Click "service worker" link
4. Run test code (provided in output)
5. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ ErrorLogger is loaded
   - üü° Expected errors show as YELLOW warnings
   - üî¥ Unexpected errors show as RED errors
   - ‚úÖ No stack traces in logged data

## Files Created

### Investigation Scripts

- `test-connection-simple.js` - Basic WebSocket connection test
- `test-list-extensions.js` - Check extension registration
- `test-reload-and-verify-errorlogger.js` - Initial reload attempt (failed due to bug)
- `test-reload-self.js` - Reload with allowSelfReload (failed due to bug)
- `test-force-reload.js` - Force reload to apply bug fix ‚úÖ

### Documentation

- `WEBSOCKET-DEBUG-ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed debug analysis
- `INVESTIGATION-SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Don't Trust Error Messages

The ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED errors were misleading - connection was actually working. Always verify current state with tools like `lsof` and test scripts.

### 2. Chicken-and-Egg Problem

When fixing bugs in reload code, you can't use reload to apply the fix! Solution: Use alternative reload methods (e.g., `forceReload` command, manual reload).

### 3. Extension Architecture Awareness

Service worker lifecycle in Manifest V3 requires careful handling:

- WebSocket connections can terminate when service worker goes inactive
- Keepalive messages can prevent this (recommended every 20s)
- `forceReload` command using `chrome.runtime.reload()` is useful for self-reload

### 4. Parameter Naming Consistency

The bug (`options` vs `params`) highlights importance of consistent parameter naming across function signatures and implementations.

## Next Steps

1. **User:** Verify ErrorLogger manually (instructions provided)
2. **If verified:** Run `/review` command for persona-based code review
3. **Future improvement:** Consider implementing keepalive messages (20s interval) to prevent service worker termination
4. **Future improvement:** Clear console on successful reconnection to avoid old error message confusion
