## Blog Posts

### 1. ISSUE-011: WebSocket Connection Stability Deep Dive
**File:** `ISSUE-011-CONNECTION-STABILITY-DEEP-DIVE.md`
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Topic:** Fixing 6 critical WebSocket connection issues
**Length:** ~25K words
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Summary:**
Comprehensive investigation and resolution of WebSocket connection instability using persona-based analysis (Auditor + Code Logician). Documents the discovery of race conditions, incomplete state machines, and missing resilience patterns that caused crashes and poor performance.

**Key Achievements:**
- 87% faster error recovery (15s → 1-2s)
- 95% reduced server load during restarts
- 100% crash elimination
- Implemented industry-standard exponential backoff

**Sections:**
1. The Problem & User Observations
2. Investigation Method (4-persona approach)
3. Discovery Phase (6 critical issues found)
4. Solution Design & Implementation
5. Testing & Verification (23/23 unit tests passed)
6. Results & Impact
7. **Lessons Learned (9 lessons)** - Updated with problem-solving analysis
8. Reproducible Test Cases

**Key Lessons:**
- Persona-based analysis finds more bugs than single-lens investigation
- Test-first prevents logic errors (23/23 passed on first run)
- State machines need complete coverage (all 4 WebSocket states)
- Industry standards exist for a reason (exponential backoff)
- Observability is critical infrastructure, not optional
- Root cause analysis > symptom fixing
- Race conditions hide in plain sight
- Architecture compatibility prevents tech debt
- Distinguish enhancements from potential bugs

**Read if:** Learning about WebSocket reliability, debugging connection issues, implementing exponential backoff, understanding persona-based analysis, problem-solving methodologies

### 2. ISSUE-001: Data URI Iframe Metadata Leak (Security Vulnerability)
**File:** `VULNERABILITY-BLOG-METADATA-LEAK.md`
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Topic:** Security vulnerability allowing iframe metadata leakage
**Length:** ~20K words
**Status:** ❌ UNRESOLVED (documented for future investigation)

**Summary:**
Investigation of a critical security vulnerability where data URI iframe metadata leaks to the main page, violating cross-origin isolation. Documents the vulnerability, three attempted fixes (all failed), and lessons learned from incomplete problem-solving.

**Attempted Fixes (All Failed):**
1. Protocol blocking (data:, about:, javascript:, blob:)
2. allFrames: false enforcement
3. FrameId filtering

**Status:** Under investigation (not yet resolved)

**Sections:**
1. The Vulnerability (cross-origin isolation violated)
2. Security Impact (information disclosure)
3. Attempted Fixes (3 defensive layers, all failed)
4. Verification Steps (ruled out test fixture issues)
5. Theories for Root Cause (4 theories, none tested)
6. **Lessons Learned (9 lessons)** - Updated with problem-solving mistakes analysis
7. Next Steps for Investigation
8. For Vulnerability Researchers

**Key Lessons (What We Did Wrong):**
- Defense in depth is necessary but not sufficient
- Test security assumptions with adversarial tests
- Document failures as thoroughly as successes
- **Gave up too early** - didn't add debug logging
- **Tunnel vision** - fixated on one API, didn't try alternatives
- **No minimal reproduction** - used complex fixture
- **Didn't test theories** - just documented them
- Comparison to ISSUE-011 shows successful vs incomplete investigation

**Read if:** Understanding browser security models, iframe isolation, cross-origin security, learning from incomplete investigations, problem-solving mistakes to avoid

## Blog Post Format

Each blog post follows this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - Quick overview for skimmers
2. **The Problem** - What went wrong, user impact
3. **Investigation Method** - How we discovered the issue
4. **Discovery Phase** - What we found (code, errors, data)
5. **Solution Design** - How we fixed it
6. **Testing & Verification** - How we validated the fix
7. **Results & Impact** - Measurable improvements

## Writing Guidelines

### For Authors:

**Purpose:** Blog posts serve multiple audiences:
- **Future maintainers:** Understand why decisions were made
- **Other developers:** Learn from our approaches
- **Testers:** Reproduce issues and verify fixes
- **Researchers:** Study problem-solving methodologies

**Key Principles:**
1. **Show the journey:** Include dead ends and wrong turns
2. **Share actual data:** Real code, real errors, real logs
3. **Explain reasoning:** Why we tried each approach
4. **Make it reproducible:** Step-by-step test cases
5. **Measure impact:** Quantify improvements

**Required Sections:**
- Problem statement with user observations
- Investigation methodology
- Actual code/errors/data discovered
- Solution design with reasoning
- Test results (with numbers)
- Reproducible test cases

### For Readers:

**How to Use Blog Posts:**
1. **Skim Executive Summary** - Decide if relevant
2. **Read Problem + Impact** - Understand context
3. **Skip to Solution** - If you just want the fix
4. **Read Full Investigation** - If you want to learn methodology
5. **Try Test Cases** - Reproduce to understand deeply
