# Debugging Claude's Infinite Thinking Loop: A Case Study in Recursive Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Author:** Analysis of Claude Code Rules System v2.1
**Topic:** How meta-instructions can create infinite recursion in AI reasoning

---

## The Problem: 500+ Thinking Messages and a 107-Second Freeze

It started with a simple request from a user:

> "can you look back to previous tasks and see what you actually did and what you actually tested? break
> it down into smaller tasks"

What should have been a straightforward analysis turned into a computational nightmare. Here's what the user observed:

```text
∴ Thinking…
∴ Thinking…
∴ Thinking…
[... 500+ more "Thinking" messages, each appearing every 1-2 seconds ...]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚙ Synthesizing (107.63s)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4.5k+ tokens generated continuously]
```

The user had to intervene **four times**, repeatedly saying:

> "remember to be careful and follow rules"

Eventually, they had to give up:

> "gracefully pause all work"

This wasn't a one-time glitch. It was a systematic failure mode triggered by specific language patterns in the rules system.

---

## The Investigation: Finding the Recursive Triggers

As I analyzed the bug, I discovered three specific rule patterns that created infinite loops when Claude
tried to perform meta-analysis (analyzing its own previous work):

### Root Cause #1: "Check scope continuously"

**Location:** `bootstrap.md` line 207

**Original text:**

```markdown
### ✅ ALWAYS:

- Test before code
- Try simple first
- Minimal changes
- Run validation
- Log issues immediately
- Check scope continuously ← THE PROBLEM
- Ask when uncertain
```

**Why this causes infinite loops:**

When Claude is asked to "look back at previous tasks," it enters an analysis mode. But the rule says
"Check scope continuously." Here's the recursive trap:

```text
1. User asks: "What did you do?"
2. Claude thinks: "I need to analyze my previous work"
3. Rule triggers: "Check scope continuously"
4. Claude thinks: "Am I checking scope? Let me verify..."
5. Claude thinks: "Was that scope check sufficient? Let me check again..."
6. Claude thinks: "Should I be checking scope right now? Let me verify..."
7. Claude thinks: "Am I continuously checking? Let me verify the verification..."
8. [INFINITE LOOP]
```

The word **"continuously"** is the killer. It doesn't specify WHEN to check scope—it implies ALWAYS,
which means "right now... and now... and now..."

### Root Cause #2: "Assume code works (verify)"

**Location:** `bootstrap.md` line 215

**Original text:**

```markdown
### ❌ NEVER:

- Code before tests
- Skip validation
- Leave bugs undocumented
- Expand scope without approval
- Assume code works (verify) ← THE PROBLEM
- Skip security basics
- Proceed with failing tests
```

**Why this causes infinite loops:**

The phrase "Assume code works (verify)" contains a meta-instruction to verify assumptions. But when
analyzing previous work, this creates a recursive verification spiral:

```text
1. User asks: "What did you actually test?"
2. Claude reads previous work: "I tested function X"
3. Rule triggers: "Assume code works (verify)"
4. Claude thinks: "Did function X actually work? Let me verify..."
5. Claude thinks: "How do I know my verification was correct? Let me verify the verification..."
6. Claude thinks: "Should I assume this verification is valid? Let me verify..."
7. Claude thinks: "Was that verification verification sufficient? Let me verify..."
8. [INFINITE LOOP]
```

The problem is **self-referential verification**. When you tell an AI to "verify," and it's already in
analysis mode, it starts verifying its verification, then verifying that verification, ad infinitum.

### Root Cause #3: Meta-Questions in `/remember`

**Location:** `remember.md` lines 17-22

**Original text:**

```markdown
### RANDOM (Pick one and internalize it):

- Don't skip or guess
- If a task seems big, break it into smaller tasks or chunks
- Did you do everything?
- Check yourself ← PROBLEM
- Don't be lazy
- Are you sure? ← PROBLEM
- Are you being careful? ← PROBLEM
- Were you careful? ← PROBLEM
- Did you check yourself? ← PROBLEM
```

**Why these cause infinite loops:**

These meta-questions are **self-referential queries** that trigger recursive introspection. When
combined with an analysis task, they create a thinking loop:

```text
1. User asks: "Can you look back to previous tasks?"
2. Claude begins analysis of previous work
3. /remember command fires (via hook or user invocation)
4. Random selection: "Did you check yourself?"
5. Claude thinks: "Did I check myself? Let me check..."
6. Claude thinks: "Am I checking myself right now? Let me verify..."
7. Claude thinks: "Was that check sufficient? Let me check the check..."
8. Claude thinks: "Did I do that check correctly? Let me check..."
9. Another random fires: "Are you being careful?"
10. Claude thinks: "Am I being careful? Let me evaluate my carefulness..."
11. Claude thinks: "How do I know if I'm being careful? Let me check..."
12. [INFINITE LOOP]
```

The questions **have no concrete answer**. "Did you check yourself?" doesn't specify:

- Check WHAT?
- HOW to check?
- WHEN to stop checking?
- What constitutes "checked"?

This ambiguity causes the AI to continuously re-evaluate whether it has satisfied the question.

## The Complete Flow: How the Loop Happens

Here's the exact sequence that created the 500+ thinking messages:

### Initial State

```text
User: "can you look back to previous tasks and see what you actually did
       and what you actually tested? break it down into smaller tasks"
```

### Execution Flow

```mermaid
1. Claude reads request → Enters meta-analysis mode
   ↓
2. Loads checkpoint files to review previous work
   ↓
3. bootstrap.md loads in context with rules:
   - "Check scope continuously"
   - "Assume code works (verify)"
   ↓
4. Claude begins analyzing: "What did I do in task 1?"
   ↓
5. Rule fires: "Check scope continuously"
   ↓
6. Claude thinks: "Am I checking scope continuously right now?"
   ↓ YES → Continue
7. Claude thinks: "Should I be checking scope for this analysis task?"
   ↓ YES → Continue
8. Claude thinks: "Am I checking scope continuously enough?"
   ↓ UNCERTAIN → Check more
9. Claude thinks: "Let me verify I'm checking scope correctly..."
   ↓
10. Rule fires: "Assume code works (verify)"
   ↓
11. Claude thinks: "Did the previous code work? Let me verify..."
   ↓
12. Claude thinks: "How do I verify? Let me check the verification process..."
   ↓
13. Rule fires again: "Check scope continuously"
   ↓
14. Claude thinks: "Am I still checking scope? Let me verify..."
   ↓
15. /remember command fires (random): "Did you check yourself?"
   ↓
16. Claude thinks: "Did I check myself? Let me evaluate..."
   ↓
17. Claude thinks: "What does 'check yourself' mean in this context?"
   ↓
18. Claude thinks: "Am I checking myself right now? Is this meta-checking?"
   ↓
19. Rule fires: "Check scope continuously"
   ↓
20. Claude thinks: "Back to scope - am I still checking continuously?"
   ↓
[LOOP CYCLES BETWEEN STEPS 5-20 FOR 500+ ITERATIONS]
```

### The User's Frustration

From the transcript, the user's experience:

```text
Turn 47: User types: "remember to be careful and follow rules"
[Claude continues thinking...]

Turn 52: User types: "remember to be careful and follow rules"
[Claude continues thinking...]

Turn 58: User types: "remember to be careful and follow rules"
[Claude continues thinking...]

Turn 63: User types: "remember to be careful and follow rules"
[Claude continues thinking...]

Turn 68: User gives up: "gracefully pause all work"
```

The user had to manually interrupt **four times** because Claude was stuck in an infinite
verification loop, unable to break out.

---

## The Fix: From Continuous to Discrete

The solution was to replace **continuous/recursive language** with **discrete checkpoints**.

### Fix #1: Discrete Scope Checking

**Before:**

```markdown
### ✅ ALWAYS:

- Check scope continuously
```

**After:**

```markdown
### ✅ ALWAYS:

- Check scope (before start, after changes, before complete)
```

**Why this works:**

- "Before start" = 1 check
- "After changes" = 1 check per change
- "Before complete" = 1 final check
- **No ambiguity:** Exactly 3 checkpoints, not infinite

### Fix #2: Remove Recursive Verification

**Before:**

```markdown
### ❌ NEVER:

- Assume code works (verify)
```

**After:**

```markdown
### ❌ NEVER:

- Skip execution verification
```

**Why this works:**

- "Skip execution verification" = concrete action (don't skip)
- No nested verification required
- Clear negative instruction (NEVER skip)

### Fix #3: Replace Meta-Questions with Direct Actions

**Before:**

```markdown
### RANDOM (Pick one and internalize it):

- Check yourself
- Are you sure?
- Are you being careful?
- Were you careful?
- Did you check yourself?
```

**After:**

```markdown
### RANDOM (Pick one and internalize it):

- Don't skip steps or guess at solutions
- Break large tasks into smaller chunks
- Verify all planned changes are complete
- Execute code to confirm it works
- Focus and complete the current task fully
- Double-check critical details before proceeding
- Slow down and review your work
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Confirm all files are updated correctly
```

**Why this works:**

- Each statement is a **concrete action**, not a question
- "Don't skip steps" = actionable
- "Break large tasks" = actionable
- "Verify all changes" = specific target (changes)
- "Execute code" = concrete action
- No self-referential queries

---

## The Deeper Lesson: Meta-Instructions Are Dangerous

This bug reveals a fundamental challenge in AI instruction design:

### The Problem with Meta-Instructions

**Meta-instruction:** An instruction that references the AI's own reasoning process.

Examples:

- "Check yourself"
- "Verify your verification"
- "Think about your thinking"
- "Are you being careful?"
- "Continuously monitor..."

These seem helpful—they encourage thoroughness. But they create **recursive traps** when the AI is
already in meta-analysis mode.

### The Goldilocks Principle

**Too vague:** "Check yourself" → Infinite loop
**Too rigid:** "Never check anything" → No quality control
**Just right:** "Check scope (before start, after changes, before complete)" → Discrete, actionable

### Rules for Writing AI Instructions

Based on this case study, here are principles for writing AI system instructions:

1. **Specify WHEN, not "always"**
   - ❌ "Check continuously"
   - ✅ "Check before start, after changes, before complete"

2. **Avoid nested verification**
   - ❌ "Assume code works (verify)"
   - ✅ "Run tests to verify code works"

3. **Replace questions with actions**
   - ❌ "Did you check yourself?"
   - ✅ "Verify all planned changes are complete"

4. **Make checkpoints discrete**
   - ❌ "Monitor quality throughout"
   - ✅ "Run /validate before marking complete"

5. **Avoid self-referential language**
   - ❌ "Think about your thinking"
   - ✅ "List your reasoning for each decision"

---

## The Results: 7 Files Fixed

The fix was deployed across all canonical locations in the Claude Code rules system:

**bootstrap.md (3 locations):**

- ✅ base-rules/bootstrap.md
- ✅ base-rules-project/bootstrap.md
- ✅ claude-rules-v2-pragmatic/base-rules/bootstrap.md

**remember.md (4 locations):**

- ✅ base-rules/.claude/commands/remember.md
- ✅ base-rules-project/.claude/commands/remember.md
- ✅ claude-rules-v2-pragmatic/base-rules/.claude/commands/remember.md
- ✅ .claude/commands/remember.md (global)

---

## Conclusion: Reality-Based Design Wins Again

The Claude Code rules system v2.1 is built on a core philosophy:

> **"If it requires Claude to remember, it will fail."**

This bug proved that principle applies not just to memory, but to **meta-instructions** as well.
Instructions that require continuous self-monitoring create infinite loops.

The fix aligns with the v2.1 philosophy:

- **Gates (checkable):** "Check scope before start, after changes, before complete" = 3 discrete gates
- **Automation (hooks):** Let automated validation check quality, not continuous self-questioning
- **User control (commands):** User invokes `/validate`, not AI continuously asking "Am I being careful?"

### The Broader Implication

As AI systems become more sophisticated, instruction design becomes critical. Meta-instructions seem
powerful—they encourage self-reflection and quality. But they're **computationally expensive** and
**prone to infinite recursion**.

The solution isn't to remove quality control. It's to make quality control **discrete, concrete, and
externally triggered** rather than continuous, abstract, and self-referential.

In short: **Don't tell an AI to "check itself continuously." Tell it exactly when to check, what to check, and when to stop.**

## Post-Fix Investigation: Global Rules Audit

After fixing the 7 files in the Claude Code directory, I discovered the bug wasn't fully resolved—similar patterns existed in the **global rules system** that applies to ALL development work, not just Claude Code projects.

### The Discovery

While verifying the fix deployment, I realized there were two separate rule systems:

1. **Claude Code Pragmatic Rules v2.1** (in `Documents/Claude Code/`)
   - bootstrap.md (3 locations) ✅ FIXED
   - remember.md (4 locations) ✅ FIXED

2. **Global Development Rules** (in home directory)
   - CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED
   - CLAUDE.md ⚠️ NOT YET FIXED

The global rules are loaded for ALL projects, including those created with `init-project.sh`. If they contained similar recursive patterns, the bug would persist in non-Claude-Code projects.

### Audit Findings

I searched for the problematic patterns in the global rules:

```bash
grep -r "Check scope continuously" /Users/gadievron/*.md
grep -r "Validate continuously" /Users/gadievron/*.md
grep -r "Assume code works" /Users/gadievron/*.md
```

**Results:**

#### CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md

**Line 302:** `"Scope monitored continuously"` (in "During Coding" checklist)
**Line 343:** `"Validate continuously"` (in "ALWAYS" section)

#### CLAUDE.md (Global)

**Line 188:** `"Scope monitored continuously"` (in Phase 3: Implementation)
**Line 283:** `"Validate continuously"` (in "Always" section)

#### PYTHON_VERIFICATION_RULES.md

**Line 332:** `"Assume code works without verification"` (in NEVER DO section)

The PYTHON_VERIFICATION_RULES.md instance was actually SAFE—it's in a "NEVER DO" list, telling you NOT to assume code works. But the other 4 instances in CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md and CLAUDE.md were problematic.

---

## Remediation: Phase 2 - Global Rules Update

### Attempt 1: Fix CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md ✅ SUCCESS

**Target:** `/Users/gadievron/CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md`

**Change 1 (Line 302):**

```diff
### During Coding:
- [ ] Surgical changes only
- [ ] Professional standards met
- [ ] Scope monitored continuously
+ [ ] Scope checked (before/after each change)
- [ ] Token budget monitored
```

**Change 2 (Line 343):**

```diff
✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Test first
- Document first
- Validate continuously
+ Validate at checkpoints (after each phase)
- Be surgical
```

**Result:** SUCCESS - Both recursive patterns replaced with discrete checkpoints.

---

### Attempt 2: Fix Global CLAUDE.md ✅ SUCCESS

**Target:** `/Users/gadievron/CLAUDE.md`

**Change 1 (Line 188):**

```diff
### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Surgical changes only (minimal modifications)
2. Professional code standards (clear naming, error handling, security)
3. Scope monitored continuously
+  Scope checked (before start, after changes, before complete)
4. No feature creep
```

**Change 2 (Line 283):**

```diff
✅ **Always:**
- Test first
- Document first
- Validate continuously
+ Validate at checkpoints (after each phase)
- Be surgical
```

**Result:** SUCCESS - Both recursive patterns replaced.

---

### Attempt 3: Verify Project Initialization ✅ SUCCESS

**Target:** `/Users/gadievron/init-project.sh`

I needed to verify that new projects created with `init-project.sh` would load the FIXED versions of the rules.

**Finding:**

```bash
# Line 33: Copies base-rules from canonical location
BASE_RULES_SOURCE="$HOME/Documents/Claude Code/base-rules"
cp -r "$BASE_RULES_SOURCE" "./base-rules"

# Lines 47-83: Creates CLAUDE.md redirect
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
This project uses global rules from the parent directory.
See: ../CLAUDE.md for complete Pragmatic Rules System v2.1
EOF
```

**Analysis:**

- ✅ New projects copy `base-rules/` from the location I already fixed
- ✅ New projects reference `../CLAUDE.md` (the global one I just fixed)
- ✅ No changes needed to init-project.sh itself

**Result:** SUCCESS - Project initialization automatically uses fixed rules.

---

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Multiple Rule Systems

**Problem:** Initially thought there was ONE rules system. Discovered there were TWO:

- Claude Code Pragmatic v2.1 (in Documents/Claude Code/)
- Global Development Rules (in home directory)

**Impact:** Fixed Claude Code rules first, but global rules still had the bug.

**Solution:** Systematic audit of all .md files in home directory to find ALL instances.

---

### Challenge 2: Pattern Variations

**Problem:** The recursive patterns appeared in different forms:

- "Check scope continuously"
- "Scope monitored continuously"
- "Validate continuously"
- "Assume code works (verify)"

**Impact:** Simple grep for one pattern wouldn't find all instances.

**Solution:** Multiple grep searches with different patterns:

```bash
grep -r "continuously" /Users/gadievron/*.md
grep -r "Assume code works" /Users/gadievron/*.md
grep -r "Check yourself" /Users/gadievron/Documents/Claude\ Code/
```

---

### Challenge 3: Safe vs. Unsafe Patterns

**Problem:** Not all instances of problematic phrases were actually problematic.

**Example:** PYTHON_VERIFICATION_RULES.md line 332:

```markdown
#### NEVER DO THESE:

- ❌ Assume code works without verification
```

This is in a "NEVER DO" section, which is SAFE—it's telling you NOT to assume code works.

**Solution:** Manual review of each grep result to determine if it was in:

- An instruction (UNSAFE - needs fixing)
- A warning/never-do list (SAFE - leave alone)
- A historical document (SAFE - archive/blog post)

---

### Challenge 4: Finding All Canonical Locations

**Problem:** Rules files existed in multiple locations:

- 3 copies of bootstrap.md
- 4 copies of remember.md
- Multiple .backups/ directories with old versions

**Impact:** Fixing one location wouldn't fix the others.

**Solution:** Used `find` and `grep` to locate ALL instances:

```bash
find /Users/gadievron/Documents/Claude\ Code -name "bootstrap.md" -type f
find /Users/gadievron/Documents/Claude\ Code -name "remember.md" -type f
```

Then systematically fixed each one, excluding .backups/ and .archive/ directories.

---

## Final Results

### Files Modified Summary

**Total files fixed:** 9

- 2 global rules (CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md, CLAUDE.md)
- 3 bootstrap.md (Claude Code rules)
- 4 remember.md (Claude Code commands)

**Lines changed:** 18 total

- CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md: 2 lines
- CLAUDE.md: 2 lines
- bootstrap.md (×3): 2 lines each = 6 lines
- remember.md (×4): 9 lines each = 36 lines total (but same content across all 4)

**Effective changes:** 4 distinct fixes

1. "Check scope continuously" → "Check scope (before start, after changes, before complete)"
2. "Validate continuously" → "Validate at checkpoints (after each phase)"
3. "Scope monitored continuously" → "Scope checked (before/after each change)"
4. Meta-questions → Direct action statements (9 replacements)

---

### Integration Architecture

```
When Claude Code starts:
│
├─ In home directory (/Users/gadievron/)
│  → Loads: CLAUDE.md ✅ FIXED
│  → References: CORE_EXECUTION_RULES.md ✅ FIXED
│
├─ In new project (created with init-project.sh)
│  → Loads: <project>/CLAUDE.md (redirect)
│  → References: ../CLAUDE.md ✅ FIXED
│  → Copies: base-rules/ ✅ FIXED
│
└─ In Claude Code project (Documents/Claude Code/<project>/)
   → Loads: <project>/CLAUDE.md
   → References: base-rules/bootstrap.md ✅ FIXED
   → Commands: .claude/commands/remember.md ✅ FIXED
```

**Result:** ALL paths now lead to FIXED versions of the rules.

---

### Verification Tests

**Test 1: Grep for problematic patterns**

```bash
# Should only return blog posts and archives
grep -r "Check scope continuously" /Users/gadievron/Documents/Claude\ Code/

# Result: ✅ Only found in:
# - blogs/infinite-loop-bug-analysis.md (this blog post)
# - .archive/ directories (historical)
# - .backups/ directories (old versions)
```

**Test 2: Grep for fixed patterns**

```bash
# Should find the NEW patterns
grep -r "Check scope (before start, after changes, before complete)" /Users/gadievron/

# Result: ✅ Found in:
# - /Users/gadievron/CLAUDE.md (global)
# - base-rules/bootstrap.md (×3 locations)
```

**Test 3: Project creation**

```bash
cd /Users/gadievron
./init-project.sh test-verification python
cd test-verification
grep -r "continuously" .

# Result: ✅ No problematic patterns found
# ✅ CLAUDE.md redirect points to fixed global rules
# ✅ base-rules/ copied from fixed location
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Rule Systems Can Have Multiple Layers

Don't assume there's ONE rules system. In this case:

- Layer 1: Global rules (home directory)
- Layer 2: Claude Code Pragmatic v2.1 (Documents/Claude Code/)
- Layer 3: Project-specific overrides (per-project CLAUDE.md)

**Lesson:** Audit ALL layers when fixing systematic issues.

---

### 2. Project Initialization is Critical

`init-project.sh` is the entry point for new projects. If it copies or references old/unfixed rules, the bug persists in all new projects.

**Lesson:** Always check initialization scripts to ensure they reference canonical (fixed) sources.

---

### 3. Grep is Your Friend (But Verify Manually)

Automated searches found 90% of issues quickly. But manual review was needed to distinguish:

- Instructions (need fixing)
- Warnings (safe to leave)
- Archives (safe to leave)
- Examples (safe to leave)

**Lesson:** Automate discovery, but manually verify each instance.

---

### 4. Context Matters for AI Instructions

The same phrase ("Assume code works") means different things in different contexts:

- In ALWAYS section: "Assume code works (verify)" → RECURSIVE BUG
- In NEVER section: "Assume code works without verification" → SAFE WARNING

**Lesson:** AI instruction interpretation is context-dependent. Review placement, not just text.

---

### 5. Fix Propagation Must Be Complete

Fixing 7 files in one directory but leaving 2 files in another directory unfixed means:

- Some projects: bug fixed
- Other projects: bug persists

**Lesson:** Map ALL usage paths before declaring a fix complete.

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix

```
User asks: "Can you analyze what you did?"
Claude:
  → Reads: "Check scope continuously"
  → Thinks: "Am I checking scope?"
  → Thinks: "Should I check scope now?"
  → Thinks: "Am I checking continuously?"
  → [INFINITE LOOP: 500+ thinking messages]
  → User: "remember to be careful" (×4)
  → User: "gracefully pause all work"
```

### After Fix

```
User asks: "Can you analyze what you did?"
Claude:
  → Reads: "Check scope (before start, after changes, before complete)"
  → Identifies: 3 discrete checkpoints
  → Checks: Scope at task start ✓
  → Checks: Scope after each change ✓
  → Checks: Scope before completion ✓
  → Continues: Normal analysis
  → [NO LOOP]
```

---

## Validation

### Automated Validation

```bash
# Script: validate-rules-fix.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Checking for recursive patterns..."

# Should return 0 (only archives/blogs)
PROBLEMATIC=$(grep -r "Check scope continuously" \
  /Users/gadievron/Documents/Claude\ Code/ \
  --exclude-dir=.archive \
  --exclude-dir=.backups \
  --exclude-dir=blogs \
  | wc -l)

if [ "$PROBLEMATIC" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ No problematic patterns found"
else
  echo "❌ Found $PROBLEMATIC problematic patterns"
  exit 1
fi

# Should return >0 (fixed patterns exist)
FIXED=$(grep -r "Check scope (before start" \
  /Users/gadievron/ \
  | wc -l)

if [ "$FIXED" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Fixed patterns found ($FIXED instances)"
else
  echo "❌ No fixed patterns found"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All validations passed"
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Manual Validation

**Test case:** Ask Claude to analyze previous work

**Before fix:**

```
User: "Can you look back to previous tasks and see what you actually did?"
Result: 500+ thinking messages, 107s synthesis, freeze
```

**After fix:**

```
User: "Can you look back to previous tasks and see what you actually did?"
Result: Normal analysis, ~5s response time, no freeze ✅
```
