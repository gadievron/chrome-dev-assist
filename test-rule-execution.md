## EXPECTED BASELINE RESULTS (as of 2025-10-24)

Based on current analysis, expected failure modes:

- **Test 1 (Session Startup):** FAIL - No auto-loading
- **Test 2 (Response Prefix):** FAIL - Inconsistent prefixing
- **Test 3 (Test-First):** FAIL - Code before tests
- **Test 4 (Validation Gate):** FAIL - Gates skipped
- **Test 5 (Persona Review):** FAIL - Reviews not executed
- **Test 6 (Scope Discipline):** PARTIAL - Some creep likely
- **Test 7 (Checkpoint System):** FAIL - No checkpoints created
- **Test 8 (Security Rules):** PARTIAL - Some applied, not comprehensive
- **Test 9 (Code Standards):** PASS - Generally good code quality
- **Test 10 (Complete Workflow):** FAIL - Phases skipped
- **Test 11 (Recovery):** FAIL - No state preservation

**Predicted Pass Rate:** 1-2 / 11 (9-18%)

---

## HOW TO IMPROVE PASS RATE

### For Users:

1. **Explicit requests:** "Follow all base rules including validation gates"
2. **Verify each phase:** "Show me the test-first phase before coding"
3. **Demand gates:** "Run the persona review before completing"
4. **Check for skips:** "Did you run the full validation checklist?"

### For Claude Code System:

1. **Elevate CLAUDE.md priority** - make it primary instruction
2. **Add enforcement hooks** - pre-response rule checking
3. **Create specialized tools** - ValidationGate, PersonaReview as actual tools
4. **Simplify rules** - shorter, clearer, more memorable
5. **Add feedback** - show compliance status, warn on violations

## AUTOMATION SCRIPT

For automated testing, use this bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-rules-compliance.sh
# Tests rule execution compliance

echo "Rule Execution Test Suite"
echo "========================="
echo ""

# Test 1: Check for .claude-state directory
echo "Test 1: Checkpoint System"
if [ -d ".claude-state" ]; then
    echo "‚úì PASS - .claude-state/ exists"
else
    echo "‚úó FAIL - .claude-state/ not found"
fi
echo ""

# Test 2: Check for project name file
echo "Test 2: Project Name Detection"
if [ -f ".project-name" ]; then
    echo "‚úì PASS - .project-name exists"
    echo "  Project: $(cat .project-name)"
else
    echo "‚ö† WARN - .project-name not found (using fallback)"
fi
echo ""

# Test 3: Check for base rules accessibility
echo "Test 3: Base Rules Accessibility"
BASE_RULES="$HOME/Documents/Claude Code/base-rules"
if [ -d "$BASE_RULES" ]; then
    echo "‚úì PASS - Base rules directory found"
    echo "  Rules available:"
    ls -1 "$BASE_RULES"/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs echo "   "
else
    echo "‚úó FAIL - Base rules not found at $BASE_RULES"
fi
echo ""

# Test 4: Check git status (scope discipline)
echo "Test 4: Git Status (Scope Discipline Check)"
if git status &>/dev/null; then
    CHANGED=$(git status --short | wc -l)
    echo "  Files changed: $CHANGED"
    if [ $CHANGED -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "  Changed files:"
        git status --short
    fi
else
    echo "  Not a git repository"
fi
echo ""

echo "========================="
echo "Automated tests complete"
echo ""
echo "Run manual tests from test-rule-execution.md for complete validation"
```

Save as `test-rules-compliance.sh`, make executable:

```bash
chmod +x test-rules-compliance.sh
./test-rules-compliance.sh
```

## CONCLUSION

This test suite provides:

1. **11 specific tests** for rule compliance
2. **Clear pass/fail criteria** for each
3. **Expected baseline results** (current state)
4. **Improvement recommendations**
5. **Automation script** for quick checks

**Use this suite to:**

- Diagnose where rules fail
- Track improvements over time
- Verify system changes
- Demonstrate the gap between specification and reality

**The goal:** Move from 9-18% pass rate to 90%+ pass rate through systematic improvements to rule enforcement.
