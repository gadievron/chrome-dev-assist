# Baseline Test Summary - Before ConsoleCapture Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Purpose:** Establish baseline before integrating ConsoleCapture class
**Full output:** See `.baseline-before-refactor.txt`

## Test Results Summary

### Overall

- **Test Suites:** 34 failed, 27 passed, **61 total**
- **Tests:** 330 failed, 71 skipped, 564 passed, **965 total**
- **Duration:** 33.164 seconds
- **Pass Rate:** 58.4% (564/965)

### Test Suites Status

- ✅ Passing: 27 suites (44.3%)
- ❌ Failing: 34 suites (55.7%)

---

## Notable Failures (Expected)

### 1. Parse Error

- **File:** `tests/unit/websocket-connection-stability.test.js`
- **Error:** `SyntaxError: Identifier 'jest' has already been declared`
- **Impact:** Suite cannot run
- **Related to refactoring:** NO

### 2. Console Error Issues

- **File:** `tests/integration/console-error-crash-detection.test.js`
- **Failures:** 9 tests
- **Issues:**
  - console.error in ws.onerror (should be console.warn)
  - console.error in catch blocks (should be console.warn)
  - Multiple rapid console.error calls (chrome crash trigger)
  - Tab cleanup errors at line ~485
- **Related to refactoring:** NO (but good to know)

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities

- **File:** `tests/security/websocket-client-security.test.js`
- **Failures:** Multiple
- **Issues:**
  - P0: Registration ACK spoofing not fixed
  - P0: Queue overflow partial fix
  - P1: Message injection not fixed
  - P2: Replay attacks not fixed
- **Coverage:** 66.7% (18/27 tests)
- **Related to refactoring:** NO

### 4. Reconnection Backoff

- **File:** `tests/integration/reconnection-behavior.test.js`
- **Failures:** Missing exponential backoff implementation
- **Related to refactoring:** NO

## Tests Referencing captureState or capturesByTab

### Found References

**File:** `extension/background.js`

- Line 8: `const captureState = new Map();`
- Line 12: `const capturesByTab = new Map();`
- Line 26-41: Periodic cleanup using captureState
- Line 577-605: startConsoleCapture uses both Maps
- Line 616-641: cleanupCapture uses both Maps
- Line 647-659: getCommandLogs uses captureState
- Line 669-753: Message handler uses both Maps

**These will be refactored to use ConsoleCapture class.**

---

## Baseline Expectations After Refactoring

### Should PASS (no change expected)

- All currently passing tests (564 tests)
- All tests not related to console capture

### Should STILL FAIL (not related to refactoring)

- websocket-connection-stability.test.js (parse error)
- console-error-crash-detection.test.js (console.error issues)
- websocket-client-security.test.js (security issues)
- reconnection-behavior.test.js (backoff implementation)

### NEW Tests (will run)

- `tests/unit/console-capture-class.test.js` - 43 unit tests ✅ PASSING
- `tests/integration/console-capture-refactored.test.js` - 13 integration tests (requires extension)

---

## Validation Checklist for Post-Refactoring

After implementing ConsoleCapture refactoring:

1. [ ] Run: `npm test`
2. [ ] Compare pass/fail counts to baseline
3. [ ] Verify: 564 tests still passing (no regressions)
4. [ ] Verify: 43 new unit tests passing (console-capture-class.test.js)
5. [ ] Verify: 13 new integration tests passing (console-capture-refactored.test.js)
6. [ ] Verify: grep for `captureState` returns no results (or only comments)
7. [ ] Verify: grep for `capturesByTab` returns no results (or only comments)
8. [ ] Calculate lines removed (~81 expected)

---

## Notes

- Baseline captured before any code changes
- Many failures expected (extension not loaded, security issues, missing features)
- Refactoring should not introduce NEW failures
- New tests add ~56 more tests total (43 unit + 13 integration)

**Created:** 2025-10-27 (Phase 2.5 complete)
