---

### Task 2: Extension Startup Notifications ✅ 100% COMPLETE

**User Request:** "can we make it so whenever the extension starts/restarts/reloads/etc. it informs you?"

**Result:** Prominent notifications now visible

**Extension Console (background.js):**
```

### Task 3: Data URI Metadata Leak Fix ⚠️ INVESTIGATED

**User Request:** "follow all rules, start over what we stopped fixing in the middle and continue to fix all"

**Result:** 3 fixes attempted, issue persists, requires follow-up

**Attempts Made:**
1. ✅ Added protocol blocking (data:, about:, javascript:, blob:)
2. ✅ Added allFrames: false to prevent iframe execution
3. ✅ Added frameId filtering to ensure only main frame results

**Status:** ⚠️ UNRESOLVED
- All fixes applied correctly
- Extension reloaded multiple times
- Test still fails - metadata.metadata.secret = "DATA-URI-SECRET"
- Requires deeper Chrome API investigation

**Documentation:**
- tests/METADATA-LEAK-INVESTIGATION.md (detailed analysis)

**Next Steps:**
- Add debug logging to determine exact source
- Create minimal reproduction case
- Research Chrome executeScript bugs
- Estimate 2-4 hours focused debugging needed

---

## Architecture Question: WebSocket vs API ✅ ANSWERED

**User Question:** "do we need both websocket and api?"

**Answer:** **YES, we need both**

**Why:**
- **WebSocket:** Real-time transport layer (extension ↔ server)
- **API Client:** Clean interface layer (tests → WebSocket abstraction)

**Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns (transport vs interface)
- Test simplicity (clean function calls vs raw WebSocket)
- Future flexibility (could swap transports)

**Recommendation:**
- Keep both
- Consider renaming claude-code/index.js → claude-code/api-client.js for clarity
