/**
 * Test Implementation Notes:
 *
 * 1. All tests currently BLOCKED on extension testing infrastructure
 * 2. Tests written using Test-First approach (tests before implementation)
 * 3. Tests cover all 6 sub-issues identified in ISSUE-011
 * 4. Tests verify both positive and negative cases
 * 5. Integration tests verify real-world scenarios
 * 6. Regression tests check for similar issues in related code
 *
 * Implementation Order (after infrastructure ready):
 * 1. SUB-ISSUE A: State validation (CRITICAL - fixes crashes)
 * 2. SUB-ISSUE E: Error reconnection (HIGH - fixes 15s delay)
 * 3. SUB-ISSUE F: CONNECTING check (HIGH - prevents duplicates)
 * 4. SUB-ISSUE D: Duplicate prevention (MEDIUM - prevents leaks)
 * 5. SUB-ISSUE B: Exponential backoff (MEDIUM - prevents spam)
 * 6. SUB-ISSUE C: Registration validation (LOW - quality improvement)
 *
 * Estimated Implementation Time:
 * - Tests: 2 hours (write infrastructure + implement tests)
 * - Fixes: 4-6 hours (6 sub-issues to fix)
 * - Total: 6-8 hours
